work out 
- loading/error screen, more custom
- a useful 

use redux to centralise API fetching

Project Preview
- project title, instructions
- scoring + locations visited
  - should it automatically update even when not on the map screen?
- location content display
  - location to display depends on the user selection, not on location?
  - include # participants who unlocked the location (scored from it)

Map
- based on project modes
  - display all locations
  - display only visited locations
    - knows all the locations for the project, only shows ones that have been
      visited, need to somehow keep track of this
- logic can be done when retrieving the locations and the project, just filter
  through the locations first, before passing to locationiMap, it only displays
  so extract nearbyLocation from it? so it can have a function that sends
  API request to update location visited and change the scoring?
  - consider using trackingAPI to check if this location visited by this username?

QR code
- if scoring is QR code only, then Map should only change the locations
  based on the user

Ignore location type for locations, only consider project type
- if no scoring, scoring 0
- if by location, location visit changes score
- if by QR code, QR code change score

- if all cases, locations visited still changes.
