StoryPath is a location experience platform designed to allow users to create and explore virtual museum exhibits, location-based tours, and treasure hunts with clues.

The platform features a Web app built in React that enables users to author these experiences, and a React Native Player for deploying them, making it easy to bring location-driven narratives to life.

On the React Native Playe the user can select a location based experience (project) made on the Web app and go through the experience. Depending on the project type, can either score by scanning QR codes generated using the Web app or by visiting the location in person. Both will trigger a location pop-up showing the location content set.

This project is the React Native Player.

To run, do the following:
- clone the project
- run "npm install"
- run "npm run start"
- open the app by using the expo app or a simulator through Android Studio
